//last_name,email,age ,address and return a object corrosponding to each user.
//so we need function that 1)create a object.
// 2) add key value pair.
// 3) return the created object .

//since in createuser function we have a same function of all the object (in above case is (about) and (is18) function).
//this take a lot of memory , since we are adding a similar function to each user object.
//To overcome this problem we can create the usermethod object in which we can create all the fucntion which is comman to 
//to all user object and can pass the function reference to each object.

//now we will make more change.
//as we can see each user still contains some space to store the reference of the function.
//to nullify this , we going to learn the concept of __proto__

//consider a example ->
const obj1={
    key1:"value1",
    key2:"value2",
}
const obj2={
    key2:"value2",
    key3:"value3",
}
console.log(obj2.key2)//value2 will be printed.
console.log(obj1.key1)//value1 will be printed.

//but if try to to access obj2.key1 -> give undefined.
console.log(obj2.key1);
//But we don't want undefined value . //we want that if obj2 don't have any key(here key1) then look in another
// oject (in this case obj1).
//to do this we use the concept of (__proto__ / [[prototype]]).

//we able to create a empty object like this
//const obj={};--> this way.

//But if we wanted to use the concept of __proto__ , we create object using following manner.

const obj2_new=Object.create(obj1);//here oj2_new is created and here obj1 means that if we try use any a key which is 
// not present in the obj2_new then we will be searching the same key in obj1.
//   THIS RETURN THE EMPTY OBJECT {}.

obj2_new.key5="value5";
console.log(obj2_new.key5);//--> prints the value5 form key5 in obj2_new.
console.log(obj2_new.key1);//-> prints the value1 form key1 in obj1.
//now if we add key1 in obj2_new,
obj2_new.key1="value11";
console.log(obj2_new.key1)//prints the value11 form key1 in obj2_new.
//as first the key is check in main object and we don't able to find such key then we will be search the same key in
//__proto__ object.
console.log(obj2_new.__proto__);//prints the obj1.


// now we will be using this concept in above createuser function.

//using this user_method object as __proto__.
// const user_method={
//     about:function(){
//         return `${this.first_name} is ${this.age} years old.Email is ${this.email} and address is ${this.address}`;

//     is18:function(){
//         return this.age >= 18;
